--PORTFOLIO PROJECT
I created a portfolio as part of my nology coursework based on a design I was provided with. The specifications were:

1. Public repo on github.
2. Use SCSS for styling.
3. Follow appropriate naming conventions and coding standards.
4. Take a mobile first approach but the portfolio should be viewable on mobile, tablet and desktop.
5. Have at least 25 commits.
